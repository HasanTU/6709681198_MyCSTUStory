                whether it was playing games, birthday parties, or Hari Raya celebrations. However, I was also very mischievous. <br>\
                I once turned off my mom’s motorcycle switch while she was driving me to school. I cried my eyes out because I didn’t <br>\
                want to go to school. I even challenged others to see who could collect more money during Hari Raya. These seemingly <br>\
                insignificant moments reflect some inherent traits, such as my desire to win and my fear of facing certain things.";

                a close friend who was an older student. We played paper wars and flicked rubber bands at our arch-enemies from <br>\
                class 2/3. It was a time of truly being a child, not fully understanding the difference between right and wrong. <br>\
                I loved trying new things, became braver, and enjoyed life with the mischievousness typical of an elementary school kid. <br>\
                Although it was a fun period, it passed by surprisingly quickly.";

                I wanted to try, learned everything I wanted to know, and saw things I wanted to change. I searched for what I wanted <be>\
                to be and what I wanted to do until I finally found what I loved and dreamed of becoming. I was fortunate to find <br>\
                myself at a young age, but I also faced many challenges, such as a fear of confrontation and a shy nature. These issues <br>\
                were obstacles for me, but they never made me give up.";

                various skills to prepare for pursuing my dreams. I have reached the present with a passion for certain things, ready to <br>\
                develop and refine my skills. One day, these will be the factors that help me become the person I aspire to be.";

    <P id='text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is a journey filled with twists and turns, each moment shaping who we are and who we aspire to be. <br>
    From the innocence of childhood to the challenges of adulthood, every experience teaches us valuable lessons. As we <br>
    navigate through successes and setbacks, we discover our passions, confront our fears, and strive to become the best <br>
    versions of ourselves. This journey is unique for everyone, and now, I invite you to join me as I share mine.</P>
